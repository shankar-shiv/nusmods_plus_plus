Remarks:,,
"1. Vacancy, Demand and Successful/Unsuccessful Allocations data in this report display the module classes, selected under main list in this current round, unless otherwise stated.",,
"2. The same module may be available to different students at different ""Select Modules"" rounds. The general guide to check if the module is available in a particular round is as follows:",,
"•""Select Modules"" Round 1 is a protected round for programme requirements, restricted/direct minor requirements and CELC English requirements.",,
"•""Select Modules"" Round 2 onwards include modules selection for University-level requirement and Unrestricted Elective requirements.",,
"3. The ""Vacancy"" column displays the quota (by student's career) as at running the Select Modules allocation for this current round. It is subject to changes, such as modules allocated by admins",,
before running allocation process for deserving students. All the available vacancies of the module-class will be merged when processing module allocation for Select Modules (Round 3) and,,
"Submit Module Requests. It will be updated with ""-"" when a module class has reached to its maximum capacity. In such situation, students are not allowed to select classes or submit appeals.",,
"4. The ""Others"" column includes reasons such as class has already been allocated earlier, class is being cancelled or student's programme status is no longer active.",,
5. Please note that the total quota for most Law elective modules (across all Academic Careers) is 50.,,Page 1 of 39
