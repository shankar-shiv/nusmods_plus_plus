## Purpose

Browsing through Demand Allocation Reports to gain insights about course subscription trends can be a challenging task. It involves parsing multiple PDFs for every round, comparing trends, and examining the classes available. This project aims to streamline this process, making analysis of a course's past popularity more accessible and straightforward.
